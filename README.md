# Array Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various array-related problems, including working with basic arrays, sorted arrays, multiple arrays, rearranging arrays, and subarrays such as consecutive and sorted subarrays. Below is a breakdown of each problem type, the approach used to solve them, and how to execute the code.

## Problem Breakdown

### 1. Basic Arrays
A **basic array** is a standard list of elements stored in contiguous memory. The operations performed on these arrays include traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation.

### 2. Sorted Arrays
A **sorted array** is an array where elements are arranged in ascending or descending order. Efficient searching and merging operations can be performed on sorted arrays.

### 3. Multiple Arrays
**Multiple arrays** involve operations across two or more arrays, such as merging sorted arrays, comparing elements, or performing set operations (union, intersection, difference).

### 4. Rearrange Arrays
**Rearranging arrays** involves altering the order of elements based on specific conditions. For example, placing negative numbers before positive numbers or sorting by even and odd values.

### 5. Subarrays
A **subarray** is a contiguous section of an array. Common problems include finding subarrays of a given length with the maximum sum, or subarrays that meet specific conditions.

### 6. Consecutive Subarrays
A **consecutive subarray** contains elements that form a sequence of consecutive integers. Problems may involve finding the longest consecutive subarray.

### 7. Sorted Subarrays
**Sorted subarrays** are contiguous subarrays where elements are sorted in ascending or descending order. A typical problem is finding the longest sorted subarray in a given array.
